(preliminary draft)

It seems to be true that if God ever exists, his power is unlimited, or if he does not exist, simply believing in this imaginary God helps his followers to deal with difficulties and find the meaning of life. But does this almighty God, whether real or imaginary, ever encounter a dilemma? 

On my recent trip to Africa, the most common word I heard is Inshallah, an Arabic expression of "if God wills" or "God willing." It means that what happens in the future is in God's will. It implies that we should not worry about the future, as everything is under the control of God. However, words like this only work if people believe in them deeply, and this belief typically needs practice and training for a long time. 

It turns out that, in Senegal, there is a systematic way to train children into God's faithful followers. Many children would become talibés (meaning seekers or students) who study the Quran at a Daara (Quranic school). They receive full-time Islamic education for free, without or with little secular education in subjects like math, French (the official language in Senegal), or English. 

As a tradition, parents from villages are encouraged to send their children to urban Daaras to reduce the cost of parenting and get away from parenting responsibilities. Since religious education in Daara is tuition-free by nature, Daara has to rely on other financial methods to maintain its running. Some lucky ones can receive donations from the nearby local community, which allows the Daara to offer its talieès free food and accommodation. In contrast, some other Daaras must rely on their talieès to keep them running.

Those unlucky talieès then have to earn money for their Daaras and food for themselves. They usually are forced to become street beggars, constantly suffering hunger. Suppose they are lucky enough to survive until they graduate from the Daaras; the reality is still crucial for them. In lacking secular education, they are missing basic knowledge to survive in modern society. 

Even if the lives are so hard for those talieès, they have tools to deal with the reality: everything is Inshallah. This is the exact mentality training they receive in religious education. However, assuming receiving such religious education is why they suffer, then God is facing a difficult dilemma: If God allows them to decrease religious education and emphases on secular education, perhaps they will improve their material life and likely to reduce suffering, but they may become indifferent towards God, like what happened in Europe. Or if God maintains such religious education, God is responsible for his people's suffering.
